The barista looked at me with a look that communicated, \u201cuh, how would you know?!\u201d So I pointed at my mask which had a Starbucks logo on it. The barista looked at the siren, rolled his eyes, and responded with an uninterested, \u201cOh....\u201d.  The visit wasn\u2019t what I had expected, from what I had heard from others, and was quite turned off by the experience.\n\nWe ordered an oat latte and an americano and with the beans being more on the lighter roast didn\u2019t care for either drinks. Sadly, we had already gotten in to the car to get to a brunch we were already late for, otherwise I would have gone back in to ask for new drinks. I\u2019m sure the coffee isn\u2019t awful, with the amount of locations there must be something desirable. It just wasn\u2019t for me.\n\nWhen visiting Calgary again, I\u2019ll be sure to try another location in order to gain a better perspective of the company.",

Come Aug1 it will be mandatory to mask up that going to slow down spread.

But i went back after hesitation to let the barista know and she didnt even ask me twice, all she asked is can i make it lighter in sweet or make you another drink, and i felt so welcomed, thank you so much for making my day and for the exceptional customer service !

But then poured it in the glass and spilled it all over the espresso cup/plate and handed it to me without saying anything.\nThe espresso was over extracted and quite sour.\n\nI went back and ordered an iced latte as it\u2019s a safe bet to remove the sour taste from my mouth. The iced latte literally just tasted just like milk. Very little espresso flavor at all.\n\nAgain, absolutely gorgeous storefront and friendly baristas, but definitely need higher quality control and training with the staff.

I happened to not have my credit card on hand and only had my debit card  on me. The cashier gives me an impatient look and tells me to download the app and order through the app instead. My friend also asked her a simple question about their coffee, and she kept making a face as if she couldn\u2019t be bothered to answer. After that, we sat near the bar and as I was trying to  download the app, I overhear her telling her coworker, \u201cwho doesn\u2019t have a credit card?\u201d They kept snickering behind the bar. Mind you, we could fully hear them and they could see that we were there. I still put in the order and tipped them, but I\u2019m just so disappointed because I actually do like their coffee but it seems that the employees at this location don\u2019t care about their own customers.

He was happy to have a little conversation about the brand and shop with me and explain what they were pulling for espresso. He then pulled me a VERY lovely shot (I think it was a Guatemalan origin) - very well balanced, reasonable acidity, with nice fruity flavours followed by a smooth, chocolatey, nutty finish. Absolutely lovely!\n\nI had to get a bag to have at home, so the barista helped me pick one out - I am sipping a cup of it right now, and it is AMAZING. This place is truly incredible, it's everything a third wave roaster and shop should be - approachable, welcoming, friendly, knowledgeable, and most importantly - the coffee is AMAZING.\n\nI eagerly await the day you decide to expand into Winnipeg ;) (but until then, I'll snag a bag of your coffee everytime someone in winnipeg carries it hahahaha.)\n\nThank you for being a part of my vacation to the mountains!

The baristas let her know that they couldn't serve her if she wasn't in the store, and that she couldn't come in without a mask by law. They handled it very gracefully and professionally, and were apologetic that my drink was a bit delayed by the fuss. Overall, I was really impressed with how they handled the situation, and I'll be returning.\n\nThe drinks that I've tried there have all been great, and I love the choice between a more spicy or sweet chai latte!",

It was bad enough it was basically mummified when I got it, but I had a bite and had to spit it out. It was inedible. Needless to say, it obviously went into the compost...\n\nI think the Snickerdoodle cookie was a little on the bland side. Good for the dinosaurs in this family, but for my sweet tooth: it did not suffice. So I only had half of it.\n\nThe mascarphone brownie was bitter sweet, I don't have an opinion on it.\n\nThe chamomile tea was soooooooo soothing and calming.\n\nYeah. I had 4 desserts in one night, then washed it all down with this floral tea...\n\nThe strawberry crumble muffin was good, I had it for breakfast the next day.\n\nThe scone I had was also good, I saved it for lunch the next day.

If you want a coffee experience, true 3rd wave coffee, then go here and get a \"brew to order\" cup, pay the extra money it's well worth it if you love coffee.

To top things off this last visit one of the girls managing the very slow coffee service wiped down the table beside us which was covered  in crumbs, lettuce and avocado pieces and swept the lot off the table onto the floor and then walked away. We sat there for another 10 minutes or so and the food remained on the floor. Nice coffee and chai, delicious Sidewalk Citizen croissants and good sandwich but slow,  and mostly surly sloppy service.

The red velvet tasted like it was made by someone who had never actually had red velvet cake before. It was super heavy on the citrus and that flavor should not be there. Also, the cream cheese filling tasted salty. You know a donut is bad when dad won't even eat it. The rest of the donuts, I would describe as below average. My daughter didn't eat her cereal and milk donut, so it joined the red velvet in the trash. The churro and sprinkle donuts got eaten, but I couldn't help but think of the two fallen soldiers that didn't come back that day.\n\nAnyway, just be prepared when choosing these donuts.

My wife tried it and gagged. The taste was a strange fruit or berry taste. Please don't assume coffee drinkers are into those exotic flavour blends. Keep it simple. Also, your price was outrageous. I only bought the coffee because I didn't look for another place in the market that sold coffee. Your size is half the size of Tim Hortons large, and smaller than their medium, and over two times the price of their large. Not again.",

This spot is worth visiting.\n\nWhile still serving their speciality - coffee + hoopla donuts, they also have a savoury meal menu from sandwiches to pancakes.\n\nDrinks are consistent as with all p&s spots - good place to grab coffee and likewise drinks. The donuts from hoopla are always a good default grab as well.\n\nMeal - really enjoyed the chicken sandwich, farmers breakfast and also the rice pudding - great flavours and also simple enough to be unique (not homestyle and nicer). The only questionable one was the sourdough waffles which were a bit too tough, which made it hard to knife and fork as well and a harder chew.\n\nService was good, relatively quick (mild waiting) and friendly. Easy to order from the front counter or the QR code at each table. They also ensure everything remains clean and orderly.\n\nSeating - lots of seats in a typical coffee shop setting (long tables and along the wall long booth manner).

I don\u2019t know what sauces they put on these items, but it made them taste really weird, even my son couldn\u2019t finish the cheese sandwich. The cheese had oozed out onto the plate and half the sandwich was so overdone, he couldn\u2019t get his teeth through it. I left most of my dish.

This leaves the end product as very mild and barely tasting of espresso. There is also very little bitterness. I see from other reviewers that they like the taste of the coffee. I am just guessing that those other reviewers typically drink Keurig coffees that suffer from the same problems. If you are a true lover of espresso or coffee, you will be very disappointed, especially at the price point. If you don\u2019t really like the taste of coffee and have a lot of disposable income, you will like this place.\n\nI am giving 2 stars because I like the donuts. My son, aged 6, prefers a more basic donut with less complex flavours. Given the choice, he refers a donut from Safeway at 1/5 of the price.\n\nThe staff is very pleasant and welcoming. The atmosphere is bustling and fun, like a coffee shop in a big city. If you had a meeting or a date, this would be a good place to go, especially since you won\u2019t have coffee breath after because of the very weak coffee.\n\nThis place is kind of the opposite of the Roasterie. Instead of well brewed, complex and rich coffee surrounded by weird people, you get coffee flavoured water surrounded by Altadore house wives who drive mega SUVs.",

Regarding the options, if you want to eat a good sandwich at a reasonable price or have an after work snack and relax I would not recommend walking near a Phil and Sebastian's because the food's a combination of things that seem like they are trying to be a 5 star restaurant and not just a coffee shop in Marda Loop.

I had to get up and ask at the kitchen door for cutlery and he looked at me like I was an alien. He then took his hand and grabbed a knife and fork with his bare hand on the non handle area and said \" here\" and snarled and turned his back.\n\nA guy saw me a little disdained and approached me saying \" I am the owner\" in a very uppity way with his entourage of dogs, wife, and preppy dressed family in tow. I relayed what just happened and it was clear he could not care less. Indeed, at one point he said \" I'm surprised by this\" not even an apology or an offer to buy me a free coffee or anything.

        "body": "I've been a customer at P&S for quite some time now (1.5 yr). At first we used to just purchase beans, and buy the odd coffee every so often from the Chinook location...we really enjoy and appreciate the coffee and look forward to the treat.\n\nWe started coming regularly on Saturday mornings to the Marda Loop location buying beans, a couple of drinks and food...I always ask to leave extra room for soy... I've found if I don't emphasise lots of room when I order it usually comes filled to the top or very close. I've been asked once if I want to try a misto...I don't want that much soy milk or it that hot so I said no thank you... this was a couple months ago...and didn't think anything else of it.\n\nThat's the background.... now I'm not sure if these 2 experiences are connected or independent of each other, but it's made the experience discomforting enough that we won't be returning anymore.\n\nLast Saturday morning the barista making my americano realized after he made the coffee I had asked for room. Before putting it on the counter he poured over 1/3 of the coffee into another cup (he did it discreetly and didn't realize I saw him do it). He poured off the crema, etc and put the drink on the counter with \"extra\" room - I didn't ask for a coffee just over 1/2 full either. I'd paid 5$ for the coffee and 1$ tip on each drink I purchased...so 6$ for the coffee...and I was really looking forward to enjoying it. I quietly asked him if he could remake it because of what had happened (I was polite). He didn't say anything thing, but was visibly angry at my request, perhaps more that I saw what he'd done and I'd let him know. I thought of saying something to the manager right then as he was there serving at the till... I thought it was pretty bad that for a company whose niche is making perfect unadulterated coffee that one of their people who makes the coffee, their finished product, would do that. However, I also really didn't want to put him in trouble...maybe he was having an off day (the anger seemed misplaced...maybe something else was going on)...and I thought now he knows people pay attention he likely won't do it again...no need to make a big deal out of it.\n\nNow to this Saturday, I was told by the manager that for my americano... I would need to pay for a misto from now on. He was polite and apologetic about it, but said they'd been talking and that was the decision... I know it's not comfortable to bring that stuff up. I understand that I ask for extra room to add cold soy milk (not as much as a misto and not steamed). I don't avoid dairy milk by choice... I simply cannot drink it because of lactose intolerance and so cannot put in half and half to make the coffee creamy...you need to put in a little extra soy...but not as much as a misto. Hmmm... I thought you know I purchase beans, food, and 2 drinks and I do this on a weekly basis...I spend quite a bit of money at P&S monthly...factor in 1or 2 extra trips to the Chinook location and that's like 200$ consistently per month... An extra charge to upgrade me to a misto that I do not want, for an inch more of cold soy milk than you would normally allow.... I said no please don't charge for the misto... I promise I won't put any soy milk into my coffee today.\n\nI could now decide to start paying for a misto, so that I can continue getting what I'd like. But it's become really uncomfortable now...on morals I don't want to pay for a misto... Added onto that, the barista that got angry last week was there this morning again and stepped off the bar right as my drink was to be made, letting the other barista do it. Maybe it was just coincidence and they were changing over and I'm reading something into it that's not there. I was there on the longweekend Monday where he was pretty icey making me believe it's not my imagination.\n\nAs much as we have loved your coffee and food for quite sometime... bottom line is these two experiences have made going to P&S uncomfortable and somewhat tense...not an atmosphere we want for a leisurely coffee.We will no longer be coming back\ud83d\ude22",

I asked the barista if there was a way to avoid the long wait for a brewed coffee, his answer? \"Not really, no\".  There is a sign suggesting on nice days one can purchase a brewed coffee at the express cart outside on nice days. I guess it wasn't nice enough today.  Second time we waited too long for one of their coffees. There won't be a third.\n\nUPDATE - Sebastian personally reached out via email after reading my comments in an effort to rectify the experience we had.  I think this is excellent.  I would recommend visiting on two conditions;\n\n1. If there are 5 or less people in line (Inside)\n2. If their express cart is operating.\n\n(The coffee was quite good)",

This adventure was completely unplanned and went based off impulse and the fact I happened to walk by when it was still open.\n\nI went in an hour before closing and there was a reasonable selection left, about 8 or so. I got half a dozen, just enough for a wide variety. Basically one of every flavor except the ones with coconut because I don't consider coconut to be edible...\n\nMy only major complaint is: those long rectangular boxes are extremely obnoxious and not very durable!\n\nSome psycho squeezed the box between the back door and safety pole on the bus, while getting off. That bent the box and popped both ends open, I ALMOST LOST MY DONUTS!!!\n\nI was just amazed they didn't get squished after that ordeal, just smeared some of the chocolate frosting inside the box. But still, it made for a bad first impression.\n\nMaybe it wasn't a good idea to get these when I had a handful already, then to add rush-hour crowding with the bus? \ud83d\ude14\n\nAs for the quality of the donuts after eating them, I am disappointed to say I found them average at best. The chocolate ones were bland, the creme brulee was too sweet and the fruity flavors were all too sour.\n\nI would like to try some of the other flavors before making a final judgement, but this location only gets a fraction of the available choices.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the HOOPLA DONUTS WEBSITE must be having mechanical problems because only a fraction of what I saw during the winter holidays, were listed and some of the ones I saw in store were NOT on the list...?\n\nNot sure if there are some discontinued flavors? Some flavors were limited edition/seasonal? Or whoever the tech guy is, got distracted and didn't finish updating?\n\nI'm just soo confused about what's going on here!!!\n\nI'm terribly sorry, but I never intended for my review to be this awkward...\ud83d\ude10",

We walked into the store at 3:58pm, chatting while we waited in line as the counter employee served a group of people coffees in front of us. As we approached the counter at 4:01 she announced \" I have bad news. I'm closed\". Surprised, I asked if she could just serve us, there was no one behind us. She thought about it...\"no. My espresso machine is now closed\". To the best of my knowledge, she had just used it, so I don't think it had been cleaned or shut down. It wasn't the end of the world, but it was disappointing, it was a poor customer experience. I understand you have to close but she could have a)told us as we entered, b) locked the door at her very firm closing time or c) just wrapped up her day 2-3 minutes past closing. I've been going out of my way for years to support this business, and I felt like this was a real misstep.",

As a user experience designer by trade there are few experiences worse than someone taking my money for something they don't have - yet this happens just about every time I use the app to order any food items along with my coffee.\n\nI then arrive to find my order incomplete and unfilled without an explanation or a \"sorry\" and its somehow my responsibility to inquire where the rest of my order is and request a refund for the items they did not give me. They are never able to do the refund on the spot so I am always left leaving hoping that they will remember to return the money they happily took from me for items they did not have.\n\nQuite frankly just don't let me order those items if you don't have them in stock or better yet if you cant make it work just stop allowing orders for those items over the app altogether. Its way less disappointing to not order something then it is to order something I will never receive.",

        "body": "Went here with my family for the comic expo parade and had an awful experience. First off, I spent 26 dollars on a coffee and three hot chocolates. They Gave me a the coffee and ONE of the hot chocolates. Not one person was smiling and we waited 15 minutes for 2 more hot chocolates.....and the parade has started.\nThe coffee wasn't life changing, and the hot chocolate...nothing better than what you could make yourself. Again, not life changing.\nDid I also mention that it appears they did serve food at one time?? but I don't think they actually serve food there anymore. Lots of blacked out places on the menu....who knows?\nBut it's ok. We leave and the parade has started. My two older son is with my husband and my toddler starts getting crabby. I take him BACK into the store just to sit and it's also a bit chilly out. There was no one there.  Everyone was outside watching the parade. Only employees...maybe two? At the front\nAnyhow, since there is NO ONE THERE besides them myself, and my daughter.\nI already got my sub-par beverages and my 18 month old son fussing. Well I checked his diaper! OH MAN. he barely had a pee in there, but we had a long walk back, so I just whip zip put on another...lol I'm sure they have cameras. LITERALLY  2 seconds.\nThen a tap on my shoulder \"um ew can you not\" and I had earplugs in, so I just maybe I didn't react quick enough? Whatever the case may be...he came up and didn't like that I did that and because I chose to put the diaper on....again maybe I wasn't acknowledging Mr man quick enough, but he called me RUDE! And says something to the effect of I could get the place shut down if the health inspector sees me...a lady with a baby in a place with no obvious bathrooms, and then rudely wiped the seat we were at, like it was SUCH A BIG DEAL. Just unnecessary. Like, I am human.\nI get it. A hundo. That was not an ideal place but we were on stephen Ave, our car is SOSOSOSO far away, the parade was blocking eVErYTHing....and the coffee shop was EMPTY. Where was I to go? Lol the staff was so frosty\nAnd this gut just shames me. He never even OFFERED to show me the bathroom. I TIPPED THAT BUTTHEAD.\nAfter giving me several dirty looks, he stares into my soul (again, why this level of aggression?\"\n\"Just ask next time\"\n\nUmmmmm NO there will be no next time. Y'all don't even have food!!!!!\n\nAnd for Pete's sake. Water those poor pothos plants! They are starting to look as sad as the staff.\n\nIt's just not a family friendly place, and that is the truth all day long.\n\nKeep them pothos in your thoughts and prayers",
